## Data Requirements
The application expects to find these original game files in the `data` subfolder:
* GAMEMAPS.WL6
* GAMEPAL.OBJ
* MAPHEAD.WL6
* VSWAP.WL6

`*.WL6` data archives should be provided with any official PC copy of the original game (e.g. [1]), `GAMEPAL.OBJ` can be found in the original game engine repository (see [2]) in the ` WOLFSRC/OBJ/` subfolder.
